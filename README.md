## Experience
Katie has a bachelor’s degree in history and Certificate in American Studies from Princeton University. After serving as a Resident Advisor her senior year, she started volunteering for her local Alumni Schools Committee upon graduation, interviewing applicants and visiting high schools and college fairs.
