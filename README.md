### Hours
Katie can Zoom, come to your backyard, or meet students in another safe, comfortable environment, like a coffee shop. She’s available many evenings or weekends, working around the student’s schedule.

## Experience
Katie earned a bachelor’s degree in history and Certificate in American Studies from Princeton University. After serving as a Resident Advisor her senior year, she started volunteering for her local Alumni Schools Committee upon graduation -- interviewing applicants, visiting local high schools, and attending college fairs. She also studied in England for a year and served as a Rotary Scholar. While working as an editor in the financial industry and an account manager for a health care information company, she completed her MBA in Marketing and International Business at NYU’s Stern School.
Engaging with young people has always been her passion — from leading story times for toddlers at the local library, to coaching youth sports for over a decade, to helping high school students navigate the college process. She believes that with a balanced approach and advanced planning, students can minimize stress and find a college where they'll become their best selves.

6. Enter senior year with a balanced list of ~8-12 colleges
7. Consult Naviance and apply to at least 1-2 ‘Likely’ colleges with non-binding Early Action or Rolling Admission
8. Keep your options open and finish strong senior year 
9. Be patient as the process plays out and be considerate of others along the way
10. You’ll get out of college what you put in — pursue your goals wherever you land!
